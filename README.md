# Gotta Hash 'Em All! Speeding Up Hash Functions for Zero-Knowledge Proof Applications

Rust code can be found in `benchmarks` folder. This code was all taken from [ZK friendly hash zoo](https://extgit.iaik.tugraz.at/krypto/zkfriendlyhashzoo) to replicate results on our own systems.

All designs are written in SystemVerilog for a Vivado environment.

Hardfolder:
XXX_A: area optimized design(with design source and testbench)
XXX_L: latency optimized design(with design source and testbench)
